### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.

### Python

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

The [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) can be used two different ways.

- Copy/Paste your Python code directly into the linter.
- As an API, using the "raw" URL appended to the linter URL.
    - To find the "raw" URL, navigate to your file directly on the GitHub repo.
    - On that page, GitHub provides a button on the right called "Raw" that you can click.
    - From that new page, copy the full URL, and paste it after the CI Python Linter URL (with a `/` separator).

It's recommended to validate each file using the API URL. This will give you a custom URL which you can use on your testing documentation. It makes it easier to return back to a file for validating it again in the future. Use the steps above to generate your own custom URLs for each Python file.

**IMPORTANT**: `E501 line too long` errors

You must strive to fix all Python lines that are too long (>80 characters). In rare cases where you cannot break the lines [*without breaking the functionality*], adding "`  # noqa`" (*NO Quality Assurance*) to the end of those lines will ignore linting validation. Do not use "`  # noqa`" all over your project just to clear down validation errors! This can still cause a project to fail, for failing to fix actual PEP8 validation errors.

Sometimes variables can get too long, or excessive `if/else` conditional statements. These are acceptable instances to use the "`  # noqa`" comment.

When trying to fix "line too long" errors, try to avoid using `/` to split lines. A better approach would be to use any type of opening bracket, and hit `<Enter>` just after that. Any opening bracket type will work: `(`, `[`, `{`. By using an opening bracket, Python knows where to appropriately indent the next line of code, without having to *guess* for yourself and attempt to "tab" to the correct indentation level.

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END --- ‚ö†Ô∏è

üõë IMPORTANT üõë

**IMPORTANT**: Django settings

The Django `settings.py` file comes with 4 lines that are quite long, and will throw the `E501 line too long` error. This is default behavior, but can be fixed by adding the "`  # noqa`" comment at the end of those lines.

```python
AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator",  # noqa
    },
]
```

**IMPORTANT**: *migration* and *pycache* files

You do not have to validate files from the `migrations/` or `pycache/` folders! Ignore these `.py` files, and validate just the files that you've created or modified.

üõë --- END --- üõë

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

> [!NOTE]
> I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Adjust the code below (file names, function names, etc.) to match your own project files/folders. Use these notes loosely when documenting your own Python Unit tests, and remove/adjust where applicable.

‚ö†Ô∏è SAMPLE ‚ö†Ô∏è

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality. In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

- `python3 manage.py test name-of-app`

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

- `pip3 install coverage`
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- `coverage run --omit=*/site-packages/*,*/migrations/*,*/__init__.py,env.py,manage.py test`
- `coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

- `coverage html`
- `python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the full coverage report on my application that I've tested:

#### Unit Test Issues

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Use this section to list any known issues you ran into while writing your Python unit tests. Remember to include screenshots (where possible), and a solution to the issue (if known). This can be used for both "fixed" and "unresolved" issues. Remove this sub-section entirely if you somehow didn't run into any issues while working with your tests.

## Bugs

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Nobody likes bugs,... except the assessors! Projects seem more suspicious if a student doesn't properly track their bugs. If you're about to submit your project without any bugs listed below, you should ask yourself why you're doing this course in the first place, if you're able to build this entire application without running into any bugs. The best thing you can do for any project is to document your bugs! Not only does it show the true stages of development, but think of it as breadcrumbs for yourself in the future, should you encounter the same/similar bug again, it acts as a gentle reminder on what you did to fix the bug.

If/when you encounter bugs during the development stages of your project, you should document them here, ideally with a screenshot explaining what the issue was, and what you did to fix the bug.

Alternatively, an improved way to manage bugs is to use the built-in **[Issues](https://www.github.com/Ash-5p/six-blokes/issues)** tracker on your GitHub repository. This can be found at the top of your repository, the tab called "Issues".

If using the Issues tracker for bug management, you can simplify the documentation process for testing. Issues allow you to directly paste screenshots into the issue page without having to first save the screenshot locally. You can add labels to your issues (e.g. `bug`), assign yourself as the owner, and add comments/updates as you progress with fixing the issue(s). Once you've solved the issue/bug, you should then "Close" it.

When showcasing your bug tracking for assessment, you can use the following examples below.

### Fixed Bugs

[![GitHub issue custom search](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-search?query=repo%3AAsh-5p%2Fsix-blokes%20label%3Abug&label=bugs)](https://www.github.com/Ash-5p/six-blokes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug)

I've used [GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/Ash-5p/six-blokes/issues) to track and manage bugs and issues during the development stages of my project.

All previously closed/fixed bugs can be tracked [here](https://www.github.com/Ash-5p/six-blokes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug).

### Unfixed Bugs

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

You will need to mention any unfixed bugs and why they are not fixed upon submission of your project. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. Where possible, you must fix all outstanding bugs, unless outside of your control.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here! It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue, they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Any remaining open issues can be tracked [here](https://www.github.com/Ash-5p/six-blokes/issues).

### Known Issues

| Issue | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have horizontal `overflow-x` scrolling. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/overflow.png) |
| When validating HTML with a semantic `<section>` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/section-header.png) |
| Validation errors on "signup.html" coming from the Django Allauth package. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/allauth.png) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of, though, even after thorough testing, I cannot rule out the possibility.
